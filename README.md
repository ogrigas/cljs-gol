# ClojureScript Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life implemented in ClojureScript.
With animation, thanks to the amazing [Quil](https://github.com/quil) library.

## Usage

Run `lein compile` command and open `index.html` in your browser.

For interactive development run `lein cljsbuild auto` command.
This command will be recompiling cljs to js each time you modify `core.cljs`
and you can see result immediately by refreshing page.
